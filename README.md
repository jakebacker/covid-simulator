# covid-simulator
A simulator that models the spread of COVID-19 throughout small groups of people (and eventually an entire enclosed community)

Originally created to model the spread of COVID-19 in my friend group at school, but it has turned into a much larger project.

# Is this the same as every other COVID-19 simulator?
No! This simulator is designed to be extremely modular and take into account many different policies and behaviors that aren't typically included in simulators, as they tend to be much more specific and vary greatly. As the simulator models an enclosed community, it's much easier to specify exact (or estimated) behaviors while large scale simulators model overall behavior.

# Todo
- [ ] Restructure all the code. Make it not jank
- [ ] Visualize the data much better, allowing for more data
- [ ] Investigate https://rt.live/ more
- [ ] Input people in a better way
- [ ] Generate random people arrangements
- [ ] Consider models other than SIR
- [ ] Simulate symptom tracking
