# covid-simulator
A simulator that models the spread of COVID-19 throughout small groups of people (and eventually an entire enclosed community)

Originally created to model the spread of COVID-19 in my friend group at school, but it has turned into a much larger project.

# Todo
- [ ] Restructure all the code. Make it not jank
- [ ] Visualize the data much better, allowing for more data
- [ ] Investigate https://rt.live/ more
- [ ] Input people in a better way
- [ ] Generate random people arrangements
- [ ] Consider models other than SIR
- [ ] Simulate symptom tracking
